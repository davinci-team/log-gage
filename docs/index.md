# Log-Gage!

Hi and welcome to the Log-Gage project!

**Log-Gage!** is a tool that allow developers to fetch and monitor their AWS Cloud-Watch logs in real time and give the the ability to search through the logs, log-groups and AWS-profiles.


## Download / Installation:

You can download this tool from it's GitHub release page:

https://github.com/mim-Armand/log-gage/releases

For **MAC OSX** Please download the zip file **log-gage-X.X.X-mac.zip** and open the app ( we will, in the future, provide an installer for this platform )

**Windows** and **Linux** are not supported at this moment, we will however release for them asap if there is demand ( [Please open an issue](https://github.com/mim-Armand/log-gage/issues) ), You can also build for your own platform by cloning the repo and running the appropriate build script ( should support electron and react/redux or atleast static html client after you use Babel to build the client )

## Usage:

Just download and open the app,
You'll need to have AWS profiles set-up on your system ( which you should and probably have already if you are using AWS ), otherwise please google `AWS Profiles` to set-up your system and add AWS configurations files to it, it is easy and very useful to facilitate your usage of AWS resources in general.
